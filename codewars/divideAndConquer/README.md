Divide and Conquer approach
Divide a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.
Can decrease time complexity.

Exercise search:
Given a SORTED arr of integers write a fn called serach that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located. If the value is not found return -1.
