Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition. 
Very efficient on solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

Exercise 1 - sumZero
Write a function which accepts a sorted arr of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an arrr that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair doesn't exist.

Exercise 2 - countUniqueValues
Implement a function which accepts a sorted arr, and counts the unique values in the arr. There can be negative numbers in the arr but it will be always sorted.
