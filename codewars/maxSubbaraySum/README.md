Sliding window pattern
This pattern involves creating a window  which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window created). Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/str etc.

Exersice maxSubarraySum:
Write a fn which accepts an arr of integers and a numbeer called N. The fn should calculate the maximum sum of N consecutive elements in the arr.
